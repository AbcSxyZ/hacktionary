# hacktionary
A dictionary/glossary of terms related to hackathons, developed during the hack-the-hackathon (vol 2) conference.

The scope of these dictionary is intentionally limited to words that are either unique to hackathons or that have special, particular meaning in a hackathon context.  It does *not* intended to define words that are used in the hackathon context in the same way that they are used in other contexts.  (For example, "fundraising" and "venue" are critical concepts for hackathons but the words are generally used for hackathons the same way as for other events.)
